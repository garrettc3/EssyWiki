# wiki.core.Wiki

## Class Overview

This class encapsulates the wiki system's handling of directories, paths, indexing, and tagging. It is initialized with a variable root which defines the root path for the system, to be appended by the url of any given page or directory through the path() method. The class has methods for returning a path for a url (with or without the root path included based on whether you use get() or get_bare()), moving a file to a new path (with bounds checking on whether the new path is appropriate), and deleting the file at a path. The index() method returns available wiki pages, which for this system amounts to enumerating all .md files in the root directory; the index_by() method allows for the grouping of index results by a shared value for the given page attribute (such as "title", used in get_by_title() with a supplied title to return only those pages with the given title). Indexes can also be returned for a specific tag using index_by_tag and passing the tag; a list of all tags for all pages can also be obtained through get_tags. Finally Wiki handles searches by indexing all pags and filtering them by those whose title, tags, or body fulfill the search term (the attributes mentioned are only the default values and are capable of changing).
